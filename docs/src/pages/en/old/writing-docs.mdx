## Get started

Firstly create a markdown file (.md or .mdx) and name it so it corresponds to the <code>SidebarSchema</code> we covered earlier.
It must be in kebab-case.

Let's create a markdown file called <code>get-started.mdx</code>

Inside every markdown file you must put <code>title</code>, <code>description</code>, and <code>layout</code>.

In each markdown file put this frontmatter at the top of the file:

```ts title="src/pages/en/getting-started.mdx"
---
layout: '@/layouts/Markdown.astro'
title: Getting Started
description: Learn how to get started with Stellar
---
```

<code>Layout</code> value should always be the same.{' '}

The <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> should
be translated into the same language as the language of the folder in which they
are located.

e.g.

English translation

```ts title="src/pages/en/getting-started.mdx"
---
layout: '@/layouts/Markdown.astro'
title: Getting Started
description: Learn how to get started with Stellar
---
```

Serbian translation

```ts title="src/pages/sr/getting-started.mdx"
---
layout: '@/layouts/Markdown.astro'
title: Pocnimo
description: Nauci kako da pocnes korisiti Stellar.
---
```

Now just start writing below that frontmatter.

## Headings

I suggest you to only use h2 (<code>##</code>) or smaller since there is already a h1 at the top of the page (title).

## Code

This project uses [expressive-code](https://expressive-code.com/) for code blocks.

### Syntax highlighting

If you want to add syntax highlighting to the codeblock add language code next to the opening tics:

<code>```ts</code>

const name: string = 'John'

<code>```</code>

It will look like this:

```ts
const name: string = 'John'
```

### Code block file name

If you want to add file name to the top of the code block type title="file-name.js" next to the language code at the opening tics:

<code>```ts title="index.ts"</code>

const name: string = 'John'

<code>```</code>

It will look like this:

```ts title="index.ts"
const name: string = 'John'
```

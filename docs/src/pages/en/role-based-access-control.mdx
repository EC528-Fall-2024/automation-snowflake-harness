## Overview

This section details the implementation and management of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the Snowflake environment. RBAC is crucial for ensuring secure and efficient access to database resources based on user roles.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Snowflake account with appropriate permissions for role and user management.
- Familiarity with Snowflake's security model and role management principles.

### RBAC Setup Process

1. **Create Roles**: Identify and define roles required for your team. Common roles include:
   - `devops_engineer`
   - `database_administrator`
   - `data_engineer`
   - `security_engineer`
   - `admin_role`

   **Example SQL Command to Create a Role**:
   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS devops_engineer;
   ```

2. **Assign Privileges**: Determine and assign privileges to each role according to the specific access needs of team members.

   **Example SQL Command to Grant Privileges**:
   ```sql
   GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE devops_engineer;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE TEST TO ROLE database_administrator;
   ```

3. **User Creation and Role Assignment**: Establish user accounts for team members and assign them to the appropriate roles.

   **Example SQL Commands for User Creation**:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS krish PASSWORD='your_password';
   GRANT ROLE admin_role TO USER krish;
   ```

### Verification of RBAC Setup

1. **Role Confirmation**: Verify that all roles have been created successfully within Snowflake.

   **Example SQL Command to Check Roles**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ROLES
   WHERE ROLE_NAME IN ('devops_engineer', 'database_administrator');
   ```

2. **User Verification**: Check that user accounts are active and correctly associated with their designated roles.

   **Example SQL Command to Check Users**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.USERS
   WHERE NAME IN ('krish', 'amruth', 'hrishav');
   ```

3. **Privilege Review**: Examine the privileges granted to each role to confirm they meet security and operational requirements.

   **Example SQL Command to Check Role Privileges**:
   ```sql
   SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE database_administrator;
   ```

### Testing User Access

1. **Log In**: Use the created user accounts to log in to Snowflake.
2. **Access Verification**: Execute queries and commands that correspond to the permissions of the assigned roles.

   **Example SQL Command for Testing Access**:
   ```sql
   USE ROLE admin_role;  -- Switch to the admin role
   SHOW DATABASES;      -- Check available databases
   ```

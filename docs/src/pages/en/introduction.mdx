## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **Automation of Snowflake Resource Deployment Using Harness** project. This initiative focuses on automating the deployment and management of Snowflake resources through CI/CD pipelines, utilizing Liquibase for database migrations and Harness for orchestration. 

Our goal is to streamline the creation, modification, and deletion of key Snowflake resources—including databases, schemas, users, roles, and data warehouses—ensuring a secure and scalable environment.

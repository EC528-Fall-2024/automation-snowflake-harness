## System Architecture and Design

The Automation of Snowflake Resource Deployment project is built upon a robust architecture that integrates multiple components for seamless operation.

### Architectural Overview

- **Liquibase**: This tool is used for managing version-controlled SQL migration scripts for Snowflake resources, ensuring a consistent and auditable database change process.

- **Harness**: Acts as the orchestrator of the CI/CD pipeline, enabling automated deployments in response to code changes. Harness helps to streamline the deployment process and manage different environments effectively.

- **Snowflake**: The target cloud-based data warehouse where all resources, including databases, schemas, and user roles, are managed.

- **Version Control (Git)**: Git is utilized for tracking changes in the codebase and facilitating collaboration among team members.

### Key Design Considerations

- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to handle increasing amounts of data and users without compromising performance.

- **Security**: Proper access controls and secure handling of credentials are prioritized to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with best practices.

- **Efficiency**: Automation of deployment processes minimizes manual intervention, reduces errors, and accelerates the delivery of updates.

## Users/Personas of the Project

The project will primarily serve the following user personas, each with specific interactions and responsibilities:

- **DevOps Engineers**: 
  - **Responsibilities**: Manage the CI/CD pipelines and ensure smooth deployment of Snowflake resources.
  - **Interaction**: Configure and manage CI/CD pipelines in Harness, monitor performance, and troubleshoot issues.
  
- **Database Administrators**: 
  - **Responsibilities**: Oversee Snowflake resource configurations and use the automation to deploy database changes.
  - **Interaction**: Review and approve Liquibase migration scripts, ensure resource integrity, and manage performance.

- **Data Engineers**: 
  - **Responsibilities**: Manage the data warehouse environment and ensure that changes to databases and schemas are rolled out without manual intervention.
  - **Interaction**: Monitor data warehouse performance, validate data integrity post-deployment, and provide feedback for improvements.

- **Security Engineers**: 
  - **Responsibilities**: Monitor and manage role-based access control and ensure the secure deployment of resources.
  - **Interaction**: Set up access controls, conduct audits, and monitor for security breaches.
